# 💡 C Language Learning Hub

A fun and modular C project built to **demonstrate all the basics of the C programming language** — from variables and loops to file handling and dynamic memory!

Each mini-program (calculator, guessing game, string tools, etc.) teaches a core concept, all wrapped in a simple **menu-driven CLI**.
