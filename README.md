# 💡 C Language Learning Hub

A fun and modular C project built to **demonstrate all the basics of the C programming language** — from variables and loops to file handling and dynamic memory!

Each mini-program (calculator, guessing game, string tools, etc.) teaches a core concept, all wrapped in a simple **menu-driven CLI**.

---

## 🚀 What’s Inside?

✅ Beginner-friendly C code  
✅ Fully modular — each feature is a separate `.c/.h` file  
✅ Covers key topics: **functions, arrays, strings, pointers, malloc, file I/O**, and more

---

## 🧠 How to Run

```bash
gcc main.c calculator.c guess_game.c array_analyzer.c file_notepad.c dynamic_memory.c string_tools.c -o hub
./hub
```
